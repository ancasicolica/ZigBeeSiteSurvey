          | A node.js tool for ZigBee range measurements using a RapidConnect USB stick from&nbsp;
          a(href='http://mmbnetworks.com/') MMB Networks
          | . This tool was just a proof-of-concept and there were
          |             no intentions to maintain it for a long time. But whenever you create something others consider as useful, you can't hide...
        p
          | Using this tool you can scan the RSSI/LQI values for all ZigBee networks in your area (you don't have to join
          | them, just being in range is enough) and log the RSSI/LQI values for a specific network. This is very
          | helpful if you experience connectivity problems with your ZigBee network.

            span.octicon.octicon-link
          | Prerequisites
        p
          | This tool requires a current node.js release (node 4 and higher, the LTS version 4 is recommended and the only tested version) and a ready to operate RapidConnect USB dongle. There are two
          | different dongles available:
        ul
          li
            strong Z357PA30-USB-P-NC-N-X
            | : this is the ZigBee HA (HomeAutomation) version. Recommended as future extensions are probably only supported by this type.
          li
            strong Z357PA22-USB-P-TC-N-C
            | : this is the ZigBee SE (SmartEnergy) version.

        p The dongles are available from a distributor like Avnet.
        h4 Operating Systems
        |         The tool was tested with the following operating systems:
        ul
          li Mac OS X 10.10/10.11
          li Windows 7 (64 Bit)
          li Windows 8.1
          li Windows 10
          li Ubuntu 14.04
          li Raspberry Pi 2 with Raspbian
        p
          | It runs best using the Google Chrome browser but other modern browsers like Firefox or Opera should work as well. Some people also state that the tool works with the Internet Explorer, but using this browser is not recommended anyway.

            | Download the latest release of the ZigBee Survey Tool (the binaries, not the sources) build, extract it to a location of your choice. Windows users should use a short root path (e.g. "C:\zigbee") as there are issues with Windows Explorer: the length of the folder structure exceeds 255 characters.

          | Homemade build (Mac, Linux and Windows)
        |         If you want to build the tool on your own, you need some additional development tools on your machine in order to compile the native sources. Check&nbsp;
        a(href='https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/', target='_blank') TooTallNates node-gyp page
        |  for the tools needed for your operating system before
        |         running
        code npm install
        | .
        h4 Raspberry Pi Notes
        |         Install libudev-dev before running npm install:
        code sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
        | . The USB dongle
        |         does not need a driver for the Raspberry Pi. Connect the Raspberry Pi with the network and connect to the
        |         webserver using a tablet or smartphone.

          | by clicking on its extended

        p
          | Use the log field to enter some data (e.g. 'Room 201') and press the button right of the input. This logs the
          | measurement and adds
          | it to the list.
        p
          | After finishing your survey, print the page (generate a PDF) and return to the main page. The other networks
          | are not scanned while analyzing a specific one.

          | Technical information
        p The tool sends periodically a 'Beacon Request', which is a broadcast targeting all active devices on the channel. This includes ZigBee coordinators and routers.
          | When such a device receives the beacon request, it responses with a 'Beacon' (or as some say, with a 'Beacon Response'). This response contains the following information:
        ul
          li PAN ID ('Personal Area Network' ID), a 16 bit long identifier which is unique for each ZigBee channel.
          li Extended PAN ID, the 'MAC-Address' of the ZigBee device. The first few bytes identify the manufacturer of the device.
          li Permit association: flag whether new devices can join a network or not.
          li ZigBee Protocol and stack information
          li Routing and Coordinator capabilities
          li ... and many things more, see the screenshot below
        p The software on the USB dongle gets the signal strength of the received beacon response which is displayed then in the tool.
